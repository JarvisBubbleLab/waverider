      <h2>Who We Are</h2>

      <p>
        Jarvis Bubble Lab is committed to empowering traders through live education and resources for trading futures, specifically Nasdaq, NQ, and MNQ.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our Offerings</strong><br>
        We provide a unique educational software product called Jarvis, designed to help users learn and practice futures trading concepts in a simulated environment. When you become a site member, you’re granted access to an interactive dashboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jarvis analyzes the market and generates phantom (hypothetical) trades, you practice execution by recording simulated actions inside your dashboard. Jarvis sends educational notifications that temporarily unlock simulated enter and exit buttons for training purposes only.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ll have five seconds to respond before the system closes the simulated opportunity. This mechanic is intentionally designed to reinforce focus, timing, and execution discipline.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result of every simulated trade you take is recorded in your phantom ledger balance, which is used solely for educational tracking.
        Jarvis emphasizes eyes on the charts and hands-on execution discipline, helping users build consistency, awareness, and confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, Jarvis displays BUBBLES on the chart to visually represent simulated profit targets and stop-loss levels used by the software. These visuals are not trade recommendations and are provided solely to enhance learning and clarity.
