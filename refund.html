  <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    At Jarvis Bubble Lab, we are committed to providing high-quality educational content and tools. Please review our refund policy carefully before purchasing any membership, course, or service.
    </p>
    <p>
    Digital Products & Memberships
    All memberships, subscriptions, digital courses, educational content, and downloadable materials are non-refundable once access has been granted. Due to the digital nature of our offerings, all sales are final.
    </p>
    <p>
    Free Trials
    If a free trial is offered, users may cancel at any time during the trial period to avoid being charged. Once the trial converts to a paid membership, the purchase becomes non-refundable.
    </p>
    <p>
    Subscription Cancellations
    You may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future billing. Cancellation stops future charges but does not result in a refund for any previously billed period. Access will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
    Simulated Trading, and Challenges
    Any simulated trading accounts, prop-style challenges, or educational demonstrations are provided strictly for training and evaluation purposes only and are non-refundable.
    </p>
    <p>
    No Guarantees
    Jarvis Bubble Lab does not guarantee results, profitability, or success of any kind. Refunds will not be issued based on performance, trading outcomes, or unmet expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
    Technical Issues
    If you experience technical issues that prevent access to purchased content, please contact support. We will make reasonable efforts to resolve access-related problems, but refunds are not guaranteed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Chargebacks
    Initiating a chargeback without contacting support first may result in immediate account suspension and permanent loss of access to all services.
    </p>
    <p>
    Policy Updates
    Jarvis Bubble Lab reserves the right to update or modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting.
    </p>
    <p>

    If you have questions regarding this policy, please contact our support team through the official Jarvis Bubble Lab website.
